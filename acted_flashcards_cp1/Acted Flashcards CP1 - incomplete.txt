Introduction	"<div><span style=""color:#EE0000"">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
these flashcards cover the key areas of the subject CP1 course that students
may like to commit to memory.<br>
<br>
However, all individuals have their own learning preferences: some may prefer
to cover even more material than we have included here and add additional cards
to the set, while others may prefer to select a subset of these flashcards to
use for revision.</div>
<div><br>
<br>
<span style=""color:#EE0000"">Part of your overall study plan&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br>
Flashcards should not be used to complement your other study and revision
materials. They are not a shortcut to success, but they should help to provide
a summary of the essential material required to pass the subject CP1 exam.<br>
<br>
However, being able to use and apply the knowledge you acquire is also a vital
skill and so it is important that you still practise answering lots of
questions (from practice questions at the end of the chapters, assignments,
past papers, and the mock exams) as part of your revision.<br>
<br>
Therefore, after completing a ser of cards on a particular topic, we recommend
that you then attempt<b>&nbsp;pass exam questions on that topic only.</b>&nbsp;(Use
of the Revision Notes or the cross-reference grid in the ASET will be extremely
helpful here.) Attempting three to five questions on the topic will consolidate
your understanding and get you up to exam speed. We suggest&nbsp;using the
2018-2022 past papers for this purpose and the practice questions at the end of
each chapter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When all the individual topics and completed (possibly
several times), the final part of your revision is to attempt&nbsp;<b>complete
exam papers.&nbsp;</b>We suggest using the 2023-2024 past papers and /or latest
mock exams for this purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style=""color:#EE0000"">How to use the flashcards</span></div>
<div>We expect students to have their own preferred method of
using flashcards, but if you would like further guidance then some suggestions
are given below.</div>
<div>Flashcards have questions on one side and the answers on the
reverse – and hence we recommend that you use the cards actively and test
yourself as you go. However, you can use the reverse side of the cards as a
standalone revision tool if you prefer from time to time. The tick boxes in the
bottom right-hand corner of each card can be used to record successful
attempts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order&nbsp;<i>recall&nbsp;</i>key&nbsp;information
effectively, revision requires that you practise <i>recalling. </i>The best way
to do this is to use the questions on the cards to <b>test yourself</b> by either
saying the answer out loud or writing it (or both, as a multi-sensory approach
is shown to be even more effective). Once you have done this <i>then </i>check
to see whether you’ve got it right.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img alt=""Text Box: Don’t kid yourself. Simply reading the questions and answers without testing yourself will not help you to retain the information. Reading notes it the least efficient way of learning (less than 10% of the information will be retained)."" src=""clip_image001-285558d242a622180f14c3133ced63c5562d0ce5.png"">&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>text box: Don’t kid yourself. Simply reading the questions and answers
without testing yourself will <i>not</i> help you to retain the information.
Reading notes it the least efficient way of learning (less than 10% of the
information will be retained).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you get the <b>answer right</b> first time, tick one of
the boxes (if possible). If you get the <b>answer wrong, </b>go back and
immediately retest yourself, continuing to do so until you get it right – but do
not tick one of the boxes. Then go back through the cards that you did not get
right first time, repeating the process until you have achieve this success for
all the cards.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are using the paper version, you can place the cards
that you get right first time to one side and those you didn’t at the back of
the pile. You should then carry on until you clear your hand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Testing yourself in this manner is one of the most efficient
ways of committing information to memory. Each recall strengthens the neural
pathway in the brain and biologically this makes it easier and quicker to
recall future (<i>ie</i> in the exam).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Over the course of your revision, you should aim to have
gone through this process three or four times. This is normally enough to
ensure the information is <i>permanently </i>committed to your long-term memory.</div>"

11 Explain the broad approach of banking and insurance regulation to ensuing the capital adequacy and solvency of a provider	"<b>capital adequacy and solvency&nbsp;<br></b><br>Capital adequacy and solvency form part of banking and insurance regulation which sets a framework on how financial institution measure their capital adequacy and solvency.<br><br>Financial institutions need to determine the minimum capital that they are required to hold.

This might be expressed as a monetary amount but is more commonly stated as a percentage of liabilities plus capital requirements or a multiple of the capital requirements.<br><br>Increasingly, and largely driven by the available computing power, States are moving towards risk-based capital requirements such as the structures behind the EU Solvency II regime. Earlier simple formulae-based approaches are becoming outdated.<br><br><br>---my note<br><br>1. to make sure the capital requirement for each provider is customised for their risks like solvency 2<br><br>2. risk based approach is more efficient than fixed capital requirements <br><br>AI: “Banking and insurance regulation is moving toward risk-based approaches to ensure that each provider holds enough capital to match its specific risks, making the system safer and more efficient than applying the same fixed requirements to everyone.”<br><br><br>-----------------<br><div>That’s a very clear answer—and you’re explaining both the <strong>customization</strong> and the <strong>efficiency</strong> of the risk-based approach.

12 Explain how age affects lifestyle considerations when it comes to the need for financial products	<b>The effect of age on lifestyle&nbsp;</b><br><br>Young people demand loans and mortgages, but few create a demand for savings.<br><br>Slightly older people pay off their loans and start to save. They may also need protection for dependants. Longer working lifetimes and increases in life expectancy will increase the need for savings, life assurance and the age to which it is required.

<h2>6 Examples of Changing Culture and Social Trends Affecting Financial Products</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<div><strong>Increased Home Ownership → More Demand for Mortgages</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>As more people aspire to own homes, banks and lenders offer a wider variety of mortgage products (fixed, variable, shared ownership) to cater to diverse customer needs.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Cuts in State Healthcare → More Demand for Private Healthcare</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>When government spending on healthcare is reduced, individuals turn to private health insurance schemes, driving innovation in health insurance products.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Increasing Prosperity → More Demand for Savings Products</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>As people’s incomes rise, there is greater demand for savings accounts, ISAs, investment funds, and pension plans to help manage and grow wealth.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Environmental and Ethical Awareness → Impact on Insurance Demand</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Consumers are increasingly considering whether insurers invest premiums ethically (e.g., avoiding fossil fuels). This trend leads to the development of ‘green’ or ‘ethical’ insurance products.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Rise of Telematics in Motor Insurance</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Telematics technology (using devices or smartphone apps to monitor driving behaviour) allows insurers to offer “pay-how-you-drive” motor insurance, encouraging safer driving and tailored premiums.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Social Inflation and Higher Jury Awards</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>""Social inflation"" refers to the rising costs of insurance claims, driven by factors like larger payouts from court cases. As public attitudes change (becoming more sympathetic to claimants), courts—especially in the US—may grant higher compensation to plaintiffs (jury awards), pushing up insurance costs.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is a ""Jury Award""?</h2>
<div>A <strong>jury award</strong> is the amount of money that a jury in a court case decides the defendant must pay the plaintiff as compensation. This typically happens in civil cases (like personal injury or liability cases), especially in countries with a jury trial system (like the US). High-profile cases and changing attitudes about compensation for injuries or corporate wrongdoing can lead to bigger awards, impacting insurers’ costs and, ultimately, the products they offer and the premiums they charge.</div>

The reason it may not be explicitly mentioned in the card could be because the focus is on broader economic influences, specifically looking at how they shape three distinct markets within the property sector:</div>
<ol>
<li>
<div><strong>Occupation Market:</strong> This relates to the demand for living or business spaces. A strong economy can lead to higher incomes, job creation, and people having the financial means to either buy or rent properties, thus pushing up demand.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Development Cycles:</strong> The state of the economy can impact the speed and timing of new property developments. In periods of economic growth, developers are more likely to build new properties, whereas during downturns, development can slow due to uncertainty and reduced demand.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Investment Market:</strong> Economic factors also influence the attractiveness of property as an investment. When the economy is performing well, investors may be more willing to buy property, which can drive up prices. However, this depends on the overall sentiment and factors like interest rates and inflation.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<div>So, while high economic activity tends to push up property values, the specific areas that the card highlights (occupation market, development cycles, and investment market) are the channels through which this influence typically operates. Does this make sense?</div><div><br></div>"

<div>It can also refer to employees working remotely or at locations away from city hubs, such as home offices, business parks on the outskirts of towns, or even coworking spaces outside major urban areas.</div>
<div>The trend toward out-of-town working has been influenced by factors like:</div>
<ol>

11 What are model Points&nbsp;<br>why are they used&nbsp;<br>how might they be chosen&nbsp;	model points&nbsp;<br><br>a model point is a representative single policy&nbsp;<br><br>the business being modelled may comprise a very large number of different policies and it may be too time consuming to run all of this through a model. So policies are classified into relatively homogeneous groups. A model point for each group is chosen that is representative of the whole group. The model point is run through the model and the output is then scaled up by the number of policies in the group to give the results for the whole group .&nbsp;<br><br>for pricing purposes ,model points are chosen to reflect the expected profile of future business to be sold . This could be based on the existing profile ,or that of a similar product&nbsp;

15 outline how a deterministic model could be used to determine a set of new premium rates for a term assurance contract&nbsp;	<b>using a model to set premiums&nbsp;<br><br></b>an objective will be set based on the profit criterion (eg NPV profits = 2% of NPV premiums, IRR of 7% pa) and an appropriate time horizon (eg the term of the contract)<br><br>data relating to the existing profile of customers will be collected and model points created. It will be modified for any perceived future differences in the profile of the customers.<br><br>parameter values for key assumptions such as mortality , expenses, lapses in investment.

16 explain why, in the previous example, the life insurance company may decide that the profit criterion does not need to meet for all model points.	<b>why not all model points need to be profitable in their own right.&nbsp;</b><br><br>if an all model points were profitable in their own right. This may result in a set of premium rates that is:<br><ul><li>Not smooth between different types of policyholders (eg by age, sum assured)</li><li>Not competitive</li></ul><div>it is more usual to try to ensure that the profit criterion is met in aggregate&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>the profitability of the class of business as a whole will be assessed, by scaling up the model point results, to determine if the profit criterion is met in aggregate. The set of premium rates can be varied during this is the case&nbsp;</div>
17 once Premium Rates (or charges) have been determined as part of the modelling exercise, they need to be considered for marketability&nbsp;<br><br>outlined five factors that might be reconsidered, if premium rates (or charges) are not thought to be marketable&nbsp;	<b>unmarketable premium - what could be reconsidered ?</b><br><br><ol><li>the design of the contract to remove features that increase the riskiness of the net cash flows.

18 other than profitability and marketability, what is another big consideration in determining a suitable set of premium rates?`	<b>another big consideration in setting premium rates ...</b><br><br>... is the capital requirement of the contract and the return on capital&nbsp;
19 explain briefly how a model could be used to assess the capital requirements and the return on capital when writing a new contract&nbsp;	<b>assessing capital requirements and return on capital&nbsp;</b><br><br>take the net cash flows from the pricing model and it grows up for the expected volumes of new business <br><br>the capital requirement will be equal to the new business strength plus any one off development costs, to the extent that they are not amortised and already included in the cash flows used<br><br>he expected a return on capital can be calculated by equating the capital requirements with the NPV of the profit streamline is expected to emerge&nbsp;
20 how can models be used in risk management?	<b>using models for risk management<br></b><br>models can be used to determine:<br><ul><li>the extent of a risk event that will occur with a given probability , for example, the size of an equity market crash that occurs with one in 200 probability&nbsp;</li><li>the amount of capital that is needed to support sucks running to 100 probability event&nbsp;</li></ul>
21 explain using the example why it is more appropriate to use a stochastic model than A deterministic model to assess the provisions required for a contract with a guaranteed minimum investment return of 5% per annum&nbsp;	<b>&nbsp;why stochastic models are suitable for modelling guarantees&nbsp;</b><br><br>if a deterministic model is used with an assumed investment return of 7% over the next year then the guarantee does not bite, and the resultant cost is zero. . but if investment return is assumed to be 3%, the guarantee does spite and there will be a cost. sensitivity testing could be used to calculate the cost of the guarantee on the different scenarios and to estimate the variability of the cost, but the model would not indicate the likelihood of the guarantee biting<br><br>if a stochastic model is used, investment return could be modelled as a random variable with a specified density function. many simulations can be run and the cost of the guarantee calculated in each case. A stochastic model will provide expected cost of the guarantee as well as a better estimate of the variability of the cost (as most scenarios are tested) and the likelihood of the guarantee biting&nbsp;
22 explain why even the stochastic model does not illustrate the complete variability in results&nbsp;<br><br>how can this additional variability be understood	<b>why is stochastic models does not completely Illustrate variability&nbsp;</b><br><br>the results of a stochastic model are dependent on probability distributions chosen for the stochastically modelled assumptions, their parameter values of this distribution.

02 describe the use of risk classification by life insurance companies when underwriting life insurance policies&nbsp;	<b>&nbsp;the use of risk classification in life insurance&nbsp;<br></b><br>careful underwriting ensures the risk groups for potential insure are homogeneous for pricing purposes.&nbsp; The expectation is that the life's in any particular group have broadly the same mortality / morbidity risk&nbsp;<br><br>the risk groups are defined by the use of rating factors ( for example age, gender, smoking habits, lifestyle, medical history )
03 State The limitations of risk classification in life Insurance&nbsp;&nbsp;	<b>limitations of risk classification in life Insurance&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b><br>ideally, a life insurance company should add rating factors to its underwriting system until all mortality mobility differences are accounted for.

04 explain how life insurance companies deal with the limitation of risk classification&nbsp;	<b>how life insurance companies deal with the limitation of risk classification&nbsp;<br></b><br>life insurance companies deal with the limitations of risk classification by using a restricted number of rating factors.

The main reasons for this observation are:</div>

<h3><strong>1. Nature of the Work Activity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Exposure to Unhealthy Environments:</strong> Publicans often work in environments where they are exposed to smoke (historically, before smoking bans), alcohol, and sometimes irregular working hours.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Their job involves long hours, frequent late nights, and easy access to alcohol, which can encourage unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as excessive drinking, poor diet, and lack of regular sleep.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. Occupational Hazards</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Sedentary and Stressful Work:</strong> The work can be sedentary but also highly stressful, dealing with customers and managing business pressures.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Social Factors:</strong> The social environment may normalize or encourage heavy drinking or smoking, both of which are significant risk factors for health problems.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Empirical Evidence from Mortality Investigations</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>UK Occupational Mortality Studies:</strong> Such studies have repeatedly found higher mortality rates among publicans compared to other professions. This is attributed to the cumulative effect of the unhealthy working environment and lifestyle associated with the occupation.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>In summary:</strong><br>
Publicans have been found to have unusually high mortality due to the combined impact of their work environment (exposure to alcohol, potentially unhealthy social habits, stress, irregular hours) and the associated lifestyle factors that tend to accompany the profession. These risks are supported by evidence from occupational mortality investigations in the UK.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------</div><div><br></div><div>ill health retirement results in lighter mortality among the remaining active members of a patient scheme. This is sometimes called the 'healthy worker effect' <br><br>sounds like ill health retired people have lighter mortality, which is wrong<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>-----</div><div><div>You are absolutely correct in your interpretation—and your reasoning is sharp! The <strong>statement</strong> that “ill health retirement results in lighter mortality among the remaining active members of a pension scheme. This is sometimes called the ‘healthy worker effect’” can <strong>sound confusing if not read carefully</strong>.</div>
<div>Let me clarify the concept and wording for you:</div>

<h2><strong>Clarifying the Statement</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Ill health retirement</strong> means that workers who become unwell (and are thus likely to have higher mortality) retire early due to their health.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>When these less healthy individuals <strong>leave</strong> the active workforce, the group of <strong>remaining active workers</strong> is now, on average, healthier than before.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Therefore, <strong>the mortality rate among the remaining active members appears lighter (lower)</strong> because those most at risk (the unhealthiest) have been removed from the group.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What the Statement Means</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div>The <strong>lighter mortality</strong> is not among those who retired due to ill health—they usually have <strong>higher mortality</strong>.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The <strong>lighter mortality is among those who remain actively employed</strong>, because the less healthy have exited the group.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Healthy Worker Effect</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div>This is precisely the <strong>“healthy worker effect”</strong>: When the sick or less healthy leave (by retiring due to ill health), the group left behind (still working) is, on average, healthier, so <strong>their observed mortality is lower than it would otherwise be</strong>.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>In Short</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Ill health retirement</strong> increases mortality in those who retire due to illness.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>But</strong>, for the <strong>remaining active workers</strong>, the observed mortality <strong>decreases</strong> (looks lighter) because the unhealthiest are no longer included in their statistics.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>This selective process leads to the <strong>healthy worker effect</strong>.</div>
</li>
</ul>

Let me clarify the differences between <strong>benefits scheme expenses</strong> and <strong>insurance company expenses</strong>, particularly in the context of overheads like rent, and why these are handled differently for benefits schemes.</div>

<h2>1. <strong>Benefits Scheme Expenses</strong></h2>
<div>A <strong>benefits scheme</strong> (such as a pension or healthcare scheme sponsored by an employer) incurs various expenses in the course of running the scheme. These typically include:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Administration costs:</strong> Processing claims, record keeping, communications, etc.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Legal, actuarial, and investment advice:</strong> If external advisors are used, their fees are usually charged directly to the scheme.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Regulatory costs:</strong> Compliance with relevant laws.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>No Overheads like Rent</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Reason:</strong><br>
If administration or other services are performed <strong>'in-house'</strong> (e.g., by the employer’s existing staff, using the employer's offices), the scheme is not directly billed for overheads such as rent, utilities, or building maintenance. Instead, these are considered part of the sponsor (the employer)'s general business expenses.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The <strong>scheme is only charged</strong> for actual additional costs directly attributable to running the scheme (like external consultant fees). The rationale is that the employer would be paying rent and staff salaries anyway, regardless of the scheme’s existence.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. <strong>Insurance Company Expenses</strong></h2>
<div>An <strong>insurance company</strong> operates as a business, providing risk pooling and claims payment as a service. Its expenses typically include:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div><strong>Commission:</strong> Paid to brokers/intermediaries for business generation.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Overheads:</strong> This covers office rent, utilities, staff salaries, IT systems, building maintenance, and other fixed costs required to operate the business.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Direct administrative and claims costs:</strong> Processing policies, underwriting, and claim handling.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Overheads Included</strong></h3>
<ul>

<div><strong>Summary Explanation:</strong><br>
For a benefits scheme run by an employer, routine overheads (like rent) are already being paid by the employer for the core business and are not an extra cost caused by the scheme. Only additional, directly attributable costs are charged to the scheme. In contrast, an insurance company must account for and recover all costs of doing business—including rent and overheads—in the premiums it charges.</div>

09 Describe how his sarcastic model could be used to evaluate a particular risk.&nbsp;	<b>Stochastic model to evaluate risk.<br></b><br>The variables that give rise to the risk treated as random variables with probability distributions.&nbsp;<br><br>The model must be dynamic with full interactions / correlations between variables.&nbsp;<br><br>The model can be run to determine the amount of capital that is needed to (just) avoid ruin with a given probability.&nbsp;<br>

11 Explain why phrase '1 in 200-year event' Can be misleading in relation to risk and certain risk-based capital requirements.&nbsp;	<b>&nbsp;'1 in 200-year event'&nbsp;<br></b><br>This would imply that if the event has just occurred, it will be another 200 years before they need to worry about the next one.&nbsp;<br><br>In practise, rare events such as stock market crashes and extreme weather events appear to be happening more frequently than the assumed probability indicates.&nbsp;<br><br>Care must be taken because a one in 200 year overall combined event is not the same as combined individual one in 200 year events. Due to less than perfect correlation.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br>
12 Outlined how the overall capital requirement for a combination of risks relates to the individual's capital requirements if the risk events are:<br><br><ul><li>fully dependent</li><li>fully independent</li><li>partially dependent</li></ul>	<b>Relationship between overall and individual risk cap requirements. </b><br><br>Fully dependent. The overall capital requirement is the sum of the individual risk capital requirements.&nbsp;<br><br>Fully independent, the overall capital requirement is less than the sum of the individual risk capital requirements. The difference is the diversification benefits. Under certain assumptions, the overall capital requirement can be determined as a square root of the sum of the squares of the individual risk capital requirements.&nbsp;<br><br>Partially dependent. The overall capital requirement is less than the sum of individual risk capital requirements. The diversification benefit depends on the degree of correlation, possibly negative, between the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>
13 Give examples of likely correlations between risks.&nbsp;	<b>Example correlations between risks. <br></b><br><ul><li>Inflation risk is heavily correlated with expenses risk for most long term financial products.&nbsp;</li><li>Traditionally, equity markets have moved in the opposite direction to interest rates (although this correlation has not been so obvious more recently. )</li><li>Equity market force are correlated with a higher withdrawal rates on unit linked savings products.&nbsp;</li><li>Longevity risk, (for example, immediate annuity) is strongly negatively correlated with mortality risk, (for example, term assurance. )</li></ul>

The loss may be expressed as an absolute amount or relative to some benchmark. For example, the underperformance relative to a n index.&nbsp;
19 outline three drawbacks of using VaR as a measure of risk.&nbsp;	<b>drawbacks of VaR<br></b><br><ol><li>It is often calculated assuming a normal distribution of returns, whereas this is not necessarily true in practise as distributions may be fat tailed or skewed. For example, portfolios exposed to credit risk, systematic bias or derivatives exhibit non norm distributions&nbsp;</li><li>VaR Can be calculated using a different distribution, but data is often sparse.

20 Define 'tail value at risk' or TVaR&nbsp;	TVaR&nbsp;<br><br>Tail VaR (or TVaR) Is the expected shortfall below a certain level given that the shortfall has occurred. For example, if it is believed that the average loss on the worst 5% of possible outcomes for a portfolio is $5 million. Then the tile value at risk is $5 million. For the 5% tail&nbsp;

22 Explain why, if the risks being managed at the enterprise level, it is necessary to have a coherent system of risk reporting across the whole enterprise.&nbsp;	<b>Why coherent risk reporting is important to enterprise risk management? </b><br><br>As part of an enterprise risk management, each business unit will have been given a risk exposure allocation. The benefits of diversification are likely to rely on each unit taking on the exposures allocated. Therefore, it is necessary that each unit reports on the exposure that they are taking in a consistent way. If this does not happen, there is a risk that additional capital will be required to cover the undiversified risks.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

09 What are the advantages and disadvantages of quota share reinsurance?&nbsp;	<b>Advantages and disadvantages of quota share reinsurance. </b><br><br>+ Quota share is useful for small, new or expanding sedans who want to diversify their risk, write more risks, or would like reciprocal business.&nbsp;<br><br>+ Administration is relatively simple, since it is written by a treaty and a constant proportion is ceded for all risks.&nbsp;<br><br>- It is inflexible you not the same proportion of each risk exceeded irrespective of size or potential volatility.&nbsp;<br><br>- A share of profit will also be passed to the reinsurer.&nbsp;<br><br>- It does not cap large claims.&nbsp;
10 Define surplus reinsurance. <br><br>Give numerical examples of how the proportional split of clients will be determined.&nbsp;	<b>Surplus reinsurance. </b><br><br>This is proportional reinsurance, where the proportion claims split between the cedent and the reinsurer can vary for each risk covered by the treaty. The treaty specifies a retention level and a maximum level of cover available. The proportion of risk ceded is then used in the same way as for quota share.&nbsp;<br><br>Examples a surplus treaty has a retention level of £100,000 and a maximum level of cover of £1 million.&nbsp;<br><br>Risk one. One estimated maximum loss or sum assured is equal to 500000 pounds. All kinds, regardless of size on this risk will be split 20%.

Used for heterogeneous classes of business, for example commercial property and business interruption insurance.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
12 What are the advantages and disadvantages of surplus reinsurance?&nbsp;	<b>Advantages and disadvantages of surplus reinsurance.&nbsp;</b><br><br>+ On the surplus reinsurance, the proportion of each risk passed to the reinsurer can vary from risk to risk, allowing the seeds the opportunity to fine tune its exposure. It is therefore useful where risks are heterogeneous in nature.&nbsp;<br><br>+ Surplus is useful for students who want to diversify their risk. Write more risk or who would like to be able to write larger risks?&nbsp;<br><br>- Surplus treaties are more complex and expensive relative to quota share due to the extra administration, in particular of accessing and recording issues separately. Therefore, surplus is generally more appropriate for larger, more heterogeneous risks such as commercial property.&nbsp;<br><br>- It does not cap large claims.&nbsp;<br><br><br>

For example, a projection of the future solvency position should only reflect sharp cuts in discretionary benefits being made in response to falls in asset values if the company would truly make such sharp cuts in practice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For example, the insurer may be reluctant to make benefit cuts for competitive reasons or for fear of not meeting policyholders’ reasonable expectations. In addition, the insurer may decide to defer the benefit cuts in relation to the timing represented in the model, in the hope that the solvency problems are only temporary.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In building the model, every effort should be made to reflect the actions that would be taken and the timing of when they would be taken.
